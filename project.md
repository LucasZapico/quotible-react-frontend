## Journal

- the product page should pull from all public quotes and display them in a cool experience
- The user login should should a quote and feed of quotes that the user has saved.

- Do I want to allow anyone to add quotes? That is individuals without accounts...I think the answer is no. What I would have to build to handle questionable uploads is not worth the value.

- A user uploads to the public domain a questionable quote, that is a curse, racial or sexual slur. How do we handle this?

- should quotes be public by default or private by default? Should this be a user setting?

### Home view mobile

Feed back on what? Category? recent? Recently added, by like, should this be a user setting in profile. Custom feed?
